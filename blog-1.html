                <h1>Acoustic Energy Harvester</h1>
            <small>August, 2021</small>
            <p>Problem Statement [ Why? ] : 
                Growing demand for energy, and problems of scarcity and environmental impact are at the base of a very probable energy crisis in near future. The need for energy generation technologies have increased exponentially implying the innovation for pristine energy resources. According to recent studies 65% of our nations energy generation is non-renewable (e.g. coal, natural gas, oil) , resulting in shifting of significant public resources towards clean energy transition. The solution proposed by us is a new outlook in utilizing noise or acoustic energy by converting it into energy source. By changing the format of sound processing we aim to build an alternate energy generation technology and reduce noise pollution as benefits of this project.
                Another reason is evident noise pollution in industries. The results showed that noise levels in corn mills and saw mills exceed 85dBA. The average noise level measured in the printing industry was 85dBA. It was also found that 23 %, 20 % and 7.9 % of workers in corn mills, saw mills and the printing industry have evidence of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).
                Solution [ What? ] :
                Our solution is to build a prototype consisting of three portions. The incident acoustic energy is passed through a Helmholtz resonator which boosts the signal by resonance and the output is subjected to cantilever piezoelectric sensors which convert vibrations into electrical signals. The generated electric signals will pass through a controller circuit which converts it into suitable format and finally stored in storage devices, at peripheral stage we use super-capacitors for storage purpose. The entire encasement of resonator and sensors will have a hexagon structure and can be developed for application in potential high noise environments.
                The project contains three portions that are cascaded to obtain final result. The Helmholtz resonator consists of a rigid container of a known volume, with a small neck and holes on either end to admit sound waves. The design of the Helmholtz resonator is hexagon shaped and includes cantilever piezoelectric sensors which undergo vibration converting them to electric signals. The second portion is mainly based on the circuit connecting source and storage unit. The sensors produce AC signal which will be converted to DC by the circuit giving output DC voltage. The pressure applied to the sensor can go up to 1000 psi resulting in a voltage measure up to 3 volts. The circuit implements voltage multiplier which is a special type of rectifier diode circuit to increase the output voltage and efficiency of the system. Third portion consists of storage circuit design and efficient use of generated energy. The circuits use solid state standard batteries to store the output further used for small power appliances.The innovation in converting acoustic noise energy by fresh application of piezoelectric sensor and resonator concept to produce elecrtical energy.The cascading of concepts to result in compact hexagon structural component to build prototype.The uniqueness comes in the design of the product and potential areas of green technology and noise processing being contributed by the idea.The project focuses on miultiple revenue streams based on revenue models. Such as direct sales and transactional revenue model. The product will ccontain a certain costs inclusive of primary installlation.
                Additional customization and managment  subscription will generate service based revenue. The lifetime vallue is planned to reach lower figure and varies depending on customer demands. Initiallly gross margin is modrate and expected to increase on growing supply.
