                <h1>Housing Price prediction</h1>
            <small>August, 2021</small>
            <p>Machine learning is an exciting major of research in computer science and engineering. It is considered a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) because it enables the extraction of meaningful patterns from samples, which is a capability of human intelligence. Housing price prediction model is a Linear-Regression based model that helps the user predict residential property prices in the city of Bengaluru. This model is an real life application of Machine Learning in the field of real estate used by online retailers in their websites for providing their customers with an estimate on their property. We have built an optimized version of the model which is 84% efficient and more accurate than other models. The model takes the parameters such as number of BHK, bathrooms, square foot and location and gives the price of residence as output. The data of residential prices is obtained from Kaggle, an open-source dataset platform. Data cleaning and outlier removal is done to filter the data before building the supervised model.

			The model is also implemented as a website by exporting as a pickle file and locally hosted using postman webservices. The webpage also contains user interface in form of dropdown tags for choosing the parameters and selecting the requirements. The webpage is designed using frontend tools like HTML, CSS etc. The project is an impact of Machine learning technology in the field of real estate and applied for wide usage by any user who wants to get an estimate of residential area remotely. The dataset is an open-source data containing residential prices in the city of Bengaluru from the year 2017, obtained from Kaggle repositories. The dataset contains information regarding area type, availability, location, size, society, total square feet, bath, balcony, price. The number of features will be reduced while building the model to ensure high efficiency, precise results. The data is in the form of comma separated values and will be loaded onto a dataframe in Jupyter notebook. The model is built on Jupyter notebook using Linear Regression model to obtain housing price predictor. The data once loaded onto a dataframe undergoes feature reduction, the size of the initial data is 13320 rows and 9 columns. The features area type, society, balcony, and availability are dropped then data cleaning is done to filter the data. First, we clean non available data i.e., row data points without column data points are removed using the null command. We add a new feature for BHK which represents the number of BHK of residence. Next, we convert range values of total square foot to a single integer by taking the average of upper and lower limits of the range. This is done by writing a function to convert sqft to number e.g.: Yelahanka had a range of 2100-2850 and it was converted into an integer of 2475. Price per square feet is calculated by multiplying the price with 1 lakh and dividing the product by total square feet to get the value. We then examine locations that are a categorical variable. Applying dimensionality reduction technique to reduce number of locations. Dimensionality reduction is done by classifying all the locations having value points less than 10 and putting those locations into another sub classification called as other.

            Outliers are error data points or extreme data points which may cause the model to predict incorrectly hence outlier removal is an important step in the procedure. Outlier removal can be done in two methods The first method is outlier using business logic, common retail industry knowledge like if there’s a 3 BHK place then the number of bathrooms must be 3 in this way we observe each data point and make adjustments. Making observations and adjustments for a large amount of data is highly impractical hence we use the second method which is the mean and standard deviation technique. This method makes use of statistics to ease outlier removal, we calculate mean and standard deviation of the prices and discard the points which are exceeding the deviation and closer to the mean obtained from our calculations. We plot scatter charts to observe the difference in data projection before and after the outlier removal.

            The data frame undergoes hot encoding for locations and we can build the model now. The entire data is divided into training data and test data. The ratio is 8:2 for segregation and input to the algorithm for supervised learning. In supervised learning the 
            Logic is to provide correct data points to the model and by analyzing them the model will predict test data points and the efficiency of the model is verified. We use K Fold cross validation to measure the accuracy of Linear Regression model. We find the best model for our project using grid search cv. Testing the model for a few properties and we create a function which inputs parameters such as location, square feet, bathroom, bhk and the output of the function is price prediction. The implementation part of  the model is done using postman web services. 
            The Housing price prediction tool based on Linear Regression model is built using Jupyter Notebook and implemented using Python Flask server and locally hosted using postman web services. The project’s application in the real estate industry have been explored by providing businessmen scale their residential estimation to a global level by our model. The scope of machine learning in real time applied by our Housing price prediction model conclusively provides higher efficiency compared to other variants and accurately predicts the residential prices in the city of Bengaluru and the business model can used by online retailers to expand privilege of remotely get an estimate of their residential places to their customers.
